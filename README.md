## Description

Tablinate is a ruby gem that takes arrays of hashes, ActiveRecord::Relation objects, or a JSON array of hashes, and converts them into html tables. It is intended for use in small projects or applications whose schemas are closely related to what a table's output should be.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'tablinate'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install tablinate
